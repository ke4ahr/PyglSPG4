## Purpose

This roadmap documents the planned evolution of PyglSPG4 from a
functionally correct SGP-4 implementation to a scientifically validated,
NORAD-parity orbital mechanics toolkit.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Infrastructure (Completed)

- Project layout and module separation
- TLE parsing and validation
- Julian date and epoch handling
- Deterministic math utilities
- Thread-safe architecture
- LGPL licensing compliance

Status: Complete

---

## Phase 2 — Near-Earth SGP-4 (Completed)

- Mean motion recovery
- Atmospheric drag (B*)
- J2 secular perturbations
- Kepler equation solver
- TEME position propagation
- Perigee decay detection

Status: Complete (Near-Earth only)

---

## Phase 3 — Frames & Ground Geometry (Completed)

- TEME → PEF conversion (GMST)
- PEF → ITRF with polar motion
- ITRF → geodetic conversion
- Ground station definition
- Topocentric range/azimuth/elevation
- AOS / LOS pass detection

Status: Complete (static Earth orientation)

---

## Phase 4 — Validation & Testing (Partial)

Completed:
- Unit tests for math and parsing
- Integration test using ISS TLE
- Pass prediction regression tests

Remaining:
- Vallado reference test vectors
- Multi-decade regression testing
- Error growth characterization

Status: In progress

---

## Phase 5 — Deep-Space SDP-4 (Planned)

- Deep-space resonance integrator
- Lunar–solar third-body perturbations
- Long-period and short-period terms
- GEO / Molniya orbit handling
- Time-varying drag coupling

Status: Not started

---

## Phase 6 — Earth Orientation & Time (Planned)

- IERS EOP ingestion (xp, yp, DUT1)
- UT1–UTC handling
- Precession and nutation (IAU-2000/2006)
- Velocity frame transformations

Status: Not started

---

## Phase 7 — Radio & Operations (Planned)

- Doppler shift computation
- Automatic pass-time frequency tables
- CAT control (rigctl / Hamlib)
- APRS and digipeater support

Status: Not started

---

## Phase 8 — Interoperability & Export (Planned)

- SatNOGS pass export
- CSV / JSON pass schedules
- Ground-track plotting
- Elevation/time plots

Status: Not started

---

## Phase 9 — Scientific Certification (Long-Term)

- Full NORAD SGP-4 / SDP-4 parity
- Covariance propagation
- Space-weather driven drag models
- Formal numerical validation

Status: Long-term goal

---

## Contribution Policy

Contributions are welcome in all roadmap phases.
All new physics must include:
- Unit tests
- Reference citations
- Numerical validation
